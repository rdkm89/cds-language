# Syllabus Cultural Data Science - Visual #

## Overview ##

The purpose of the course is to enable students to conduct systematic computational analyses of textual objects such as literature, social media, newspapers, and other kinds of linguistic artifacts.

Students will learn to understand the nature of textual corpora, and to apply statistical and machine learning methods for analysing them. The course will enable students to carry out projects within their primary subject area, and to reflect critically on others' analytical decisions. Students will also obtain the ability to present the result of their own analyses, and to visualize their results.

The course introduces basic skills in natural language processing and deep learning, specifically for the systematic analysis of text data. Students will learn how to develop research questions about natural language materials, to structure research projects to address their research questions, and to apply computational tools in their projects to provide answers to their questions.

### Academic Objectives ###

In the evaluation of the student’s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

1. Knowledge:
    * explain central theories underlying computational approaches to the analysis of natural language data
    * reflect on the creation, composition, and limitations of text corpora
2. Skills:
    * develop a collection of texts for analysis
    * conduct large scale analyses of textual materials using computational methods
    * choose the appropriate visualization of results
3. Competences:
    * independently reflect critically on the integration of hermeneutical-conceptual and quantitative-methodological choices for an analysis of linguistic data
    * apply acquired methods and procedures to topics from the student’s core field

## Schedule ##
Each course element (1-13) is a four hour session, consisting of a 1hr lecture, 1hr coding task explanation, and 2hrs code-along session.

1. Introductions, Python, and basic data types
2. String Processing with Python
3. Basic NLP with ```spaCy```
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Named entities
6. Network analysis
7. Text classification using ```scikit-learn```
8. Topic modeling 
9. Word embeddings
10. OCR: From image to text with ```tesseract```
11. Text classification again: deep learning and neural networks
12. More deep learning for text analysis - introducing ```BERT```
13. Creating datasets

## Reading ##
Some readings are marked with `math` indicating that students with knowledge of basic calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra can benefit from this paper. Therefore, articles marked with ```math```are _supplementary_ and not compulsory. Access to some articles may require you to be on the university VPN, or can be accessed through the library website.
